#  React DevSecOps CI Pipeline (No Docker)

This project demonstrates a lightweight, Dockerless **DevSecOps pipeline** for a React.js application using **GitHub Actions**, **Trivy**, and **Checkov**. It covers essential security scanning steps integrated directly into the CI process.

---

##  Features

-  CI pipeline triggered on every `push` or `pull_request`
-  Scans source code for vulnerabilities & secrets using **Trivy**
-  Scans Terraform IaC for security misconfigurations using **Checkov**
-  No Docker required
-  Modular and easy to extend

##  CI Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Trigger

```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
````

---

### Steps

####  Checkout Code

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

####  Set Up Node.js

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
```

####  Install Dependencies

```yaml
- run: npm install
```

####  Run Trivy Scan (Filesystem Mode)

```yaml
- uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    scan-type: fs
    scan-ref: .
```

####  Run Checkov on Terraform Code

```yaml
- uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
  with:
    directory: ./terraform
    output_format: sarif
    soft_fail: true
```

---

##  Prerequisites

* Node.js installed (`v18+`)
* Terraform file(s) in `./terraform` directory (e.g. `main.tf`)
* GitHub repository with workflow enabled under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

---

##  How to Use

### 1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-devsecops.git
cd react-devsecops
```

### 2. Push changes to trigger the pipeline:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "trigger CI"
git push origin main
```

### 3. View Results

Go to the **GitHub Actions** tab to inspect build and security scan results.

##  Future Improvements

* [ ] Add Trivy for dependency scanning (`npm audit`)
* [ ] Upload SARIF/HTML reports as artifacts
* [ ] Integrate ESLint or SonarCloud for code quality
* [ ] Add auto-deploy to Vercel/Netlify post scan

##  Questions?

Feel free to open an issue or discussion if you want to collaborate or suggest features.

```

Let me know if you'd like to:
- Add status badges (e.g., build passing, security scan pass)
- Include deployment to a platform (like Vercel/Netlify)
- Attach Trivy or Checkov SARIF reports to GitHub Security tab
```
